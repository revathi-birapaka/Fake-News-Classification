# Fake News Classifier

This project is a machine learning-based fake news classifier that predicts whether a given news article is real or fake. It uses text data, natural language processing (NLP), and classic machine learning models to detect misinformation.

## Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to build a reliable and interpretable model that can analyze news content and predict if it's fake or real, based on learned linguistic patterns.

## Models Used

The different supervised machine learning models used and compared are:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

## Evaluation Metrics

The models are evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
