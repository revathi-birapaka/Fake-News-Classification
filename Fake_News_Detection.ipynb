      " In a shocking discovery that has stunned the medical world, a group of independent scientists from an unnamed research facility claim that boiled onion juice has the power to completely eliminate COVID-19 symptoms in just three days. According to an exclusive report published on NaturalCureDaily.org, over 500 patients who drank onion juice twice a day showed a \"100% recovery rate\" without the need for vaccines or pharmaceutical drugs.  Lead researcher Dr. Maxwell Gorman stated, \"The pharmaceutical industry doesn’t want this to go public because it’s a natural remedy that can’t be patented. But the science is undeniable.\" The article also claims that the World Health Organization (WHO) is deliberately hiding this breakthrough due to pressure from vaccine manufacturers.  The report urges readers to share this information before it's \"taken down\" and includes testimonials from individuals who recovered after following this homemade treatment. No peer-reviewed studies have been provided to back the claims, but the article cites several unnamed sources and \"leaked internal documents\" from global health agencies.  The report has already been viewed over 3 million times in 48 hours and continues to gain traction on platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp.\n"

      " MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russiaâ€™s former ambassador to Washington, Sergei Kislyak, said on Saturday his conversations with former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn had been transparent and focused on matters of U.S.-Russia cooperation. Kislyak ended his tenure in Washington in July but remains a key figure in ongoing U.S. investigations into Moscowâ€™s alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Flynn was forced to resign in February after it became known that he had failed to disclose the content of conversations he had with Kislyak and misled U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence about their meetings. â€œWe only spoke about the most simple things ... but the communication was completely correct, calm, absolutely transparent. In any case, there were no secrets on our side,â€ Kislyak said during a panel discussion on Russian television. â€œThere are a number of issues which are important for cooperation between Russia and the United States - most of all, terrorism. And that was one of the things we discussed.â€ \n"
